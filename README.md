==========

A `rock` to talk to a database and make a restful API.
It is a very small little thing. But it works. Whatever.

So make sure you have `rock` installed::
    
    npm install -g rock
    rock -r myapp fritzvd/magic-pony

The server folder contains some bindings for a pg database 
through `Sequelize`.
